# Generics and Traits in Rust 2021

by Shaun Meyer

This course teaches you to use Generics and Traits in Rust to write efficient, reusable, and maintainable code. You'll
learn to use generics in functions, structs, and enums, implement traits, and use advanced features to build powerful
abstractions.

## What you'll learn

In this course, Generics and Traits in Rust 2021, you’ll learn to effectively use generics and traits in Rust to write
more efficient, reusable, and maintainable code. First, you’ll explore Generics. Next, you’ll discover traits. Finally,
you’ll learn how to leverage advanced trait usage. By the end of the course, you will have a strong understanding of how
to define generic functions, structs, and enums, how to define traits and implement them for your own types, and how to
use advanced features like associated types and super-traits to build powerful abstractions.
